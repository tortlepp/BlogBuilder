Welcome to the BlogBuilder wiki, a collection of information about BlogBuilder.  

# What is BlogBuilder?
BlogBuilder is a generator for static blogs written in Java. It takes the content from input files, processes it and finally generates a static blog. Generated blogs are pure HTML and CSS without the need for PHP, a database or other stuff on the web server.

The creation of BlogBuilder was inspired by [JBake](http://jbake.org/) but unlike JBake it does not support a wide range of input formats and template processors. BlogBuilder keeps it simple: Blog posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/) templates are used to generate the website. Also the standard template is very straight forward, without any JavaScript libraries and other stuff that distracts your attention.

# How to use BlogBuilder?
Using BlogBuilder is easy: Start by reading [[Getting Started]] to see how BlogBuilder works and how to set up a blog. Afterwards you can continue by reading [[Advanced Features]] to see how the templates are working and how to customize the blog.

If you are interested in the development of BlogBuilder, have a look on [[Development]] to see details about building the program and the development process itself. There is also a [[Roadmap]] of features that are planned for future releases.
